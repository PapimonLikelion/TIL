## 중개 테이블 활용한 JOIN 의문
- **문제**
  - 피드테크를 가장 많이 가진 피드의 id를 순서대로 10개 알려주세요 (동점일 시 feed_id 순서대로)

- **답변 1. 피드테크에서 테크 많이 쓴 feed_id를 추출하여 이를 피드와 JOIN**
    ```sql
    select feed.id
        from feed
        inner join 
            (select feed_id, count(*) as tech_used
                from feed_tech
                group by feed_id
                order by tech_used desc, feed_id asc 
                LIMIT 10) as feed_tech_info
            on feed.id = feed_tech_info.feed_id
        order by feed_tech_info.techused desc, feed_id asc;
    ```

- **답변 2. Order By 절에서 바로 feed_tech.feed_id 가 몇번 나왔는지 세서 구하기**
    ```sql
    select distinct feed.id, feed.content
        from feed 
        inner join feed_tech 
            on feed.id = feed_tech.feed_id 
        order by 
            (select count(feed_tech.feed_id) 
            from feed_tech 
            where feed.id = feed_tech.feed_id) desc, feed.id asc LIMIT 10;
    ```
    - 이미 feed와 feed_tech는 합쳐져 있음
    - 합쳐진 곳에서 order by 서브쿼리가 들어가기 때문에 가능한 것! <= Order by는 굉장히 나중에 실행된다는 것을 기억!
    - 쿼리 실행 순서를 기억해두자!

## SQL 쿼리 실행 순서
*참고: https://bicloud.tistory.com/20*
- **쿼리 실행 작동 순서**
  1. FROM
  2. ON
  3. JOIN
  4. WHERE
  5. GROUP BY
  6. HAVING (GROUP BY에서 where과 같은 조건을 담당)
  7. SELECT
  8. DISTINCT
  9. ORDER BY
  10. TOP

## JPQL로 해당 쿼리 작성하기
- **필요한 쿼리: 파트너쉽이 많은 프로젝트 순으로 반환하기**
  - **1. 이런식으로 오더바이로 해버리기**
      - 해당 쿼리의 결과는 project * partnership 카데시안 곱으로 나옴
        - select 문에 project 정보, partnership 정보도 다 때려넣기 때문
      - project 중복 반환을 막기 위해 Set을 반환할 수 있음
      ```java
      @Query("select project " +
          "from Project as project " +
          "join fetch project.partnerships " +
          "order by project.partnerships.size desc")
      Set<Project> findProjectsByNumberOfPartnerships();
      ```
      - Distinct를 쿼리에 붙이면 아래와 같은 에러가 나옴
    ```java
    Hibernate: 
        select
            distinct project0_.id as id1_1_0_,
            partnershi1_.id as id1_0_1_,
            project0_.about as about2_1_0_,

            partnershi1_.venture_capital_id as venture_3_0_1_,
            partnershi1_.project_id as project_2_0_0__,
            partnershi1_.id as id1_0_0__ 
        from
            project project0_ 
        left outer join
            partnership partnershi1_ 
                on project0_.id=partnershi1_.project_id 
        order by
            (select
                count(partnershi2_.project_id) 
            from
                partnership partnershi2_ 
            where
                project0_.id=partnershi2_.project_id) desc
